/**
 * Migratory Birds
 *
 * https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/migratory-birds
 *
 * Given an array of bird sightings where every element represents a bird type
 * id, determine the id of the most frequently sighted type. If more than 1
 * type has been spotted that maximum amount, return the smallest of their ids.
 *
 * # Example
 * arr = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3]
 *
 * There are two each of types  and , and one sighting of type . Pick the lower
 * of the two types seen twice: type .
 *
 * # Function Description
 * Complete the migratoryBirds function in the editor below.
 *
 * migratoryBirds has the following parameter(s):
 * * int arr[n]: the types of birds sighted
 *
 * # Returns
 * * int: the lowest type id of the most frequently sighted birds
 *
 * # Input Format
 * The first line contains an integer, n, the size of arr.
 * The second line describes arr as n space-separated integers, each a type
 * number of the bird sighted.
 *
 * # Constraints
 * * 5 <= n <= 2 Ã— 10<sup>5</sup>
 * * It is guaranteed that each type is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
 *
 * # Sample Input 0
 * ```
 * 6
 * 1 4 4 4 5 3
 * ```
 * # Sample Output 0
 * ```
 * 4
 * ```
 *
 * # Explanation 0
 *
 * The different types of birds occur in the following frequencies:
 *
 * * Type 1: 1 bird
 * * Type 2: 0 birds
 * * Type 3: 1 bird
 * * Type 4: 3 birds
 * * Type 5: 1 bird
 *
 * The type number that occurs at the highest frequency is type 4, so we print
 * 4 as our answer.
 *
 * # Sample Input 1
 * ```
 * 11
 * 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 3 4
 * ```
 *
 * # Sample Output 1
 * ```
 * 3
 * ```
 *
 * # Explanation 1
 *
 * The different types of birds occur in the following frequencies:
 *
 * * Type 1: 2
 * * Type 2: 2
 * * Type 3: 3
 * * Type 4: 3
 * * Type 5: 1
 *
 * Two types have a frequency of 3, and the lower of those is type 3.
